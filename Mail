Subject: Urgent: Clarification and Action Required on Reporting Manager and Timesheet Approval Process

Dear [Bench Manager's Head Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification and immediate assistance regarding a critical matter that affects my timesheet approvals and potential salary billing for this month.

As of March 31st, I have been released from my previous project and am currently on the bench. However, it has come to my attention that my reporting manager in the system has not been updated to reflect this change. Consequently, my timesheet submissions are still being routed to my previous project manager for approval, rather than the designated bench manager. This discrepancy is crucial as it may not only result in a loss of pay due to unapproved timesheets but also hinders my ability to participate in interviews for other client projects. Normally, the bench manager would facilitate scheduling these interviews, but due to the current misalignment, I find myself at a disadvantage.

Given the urgency and potential implications, could you please advise on the following:

Will the change of reporting manager from the project manager to the bench manager happen automatically in due course, or is it necessary for me to initiate a ticket to rectify this manually?
Could you confirm who my current bench manager is so that I may direct future timesheets and communications appropriately?
Your prompt response and assistance in resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated, as it will ensure the smooth continuation of my professional responsibilities and prevent any unnecessary disruptions to my salary billing.

Thank you very much for your attention to this matter. I am available for any further information or clarification that might be needed.

Warm regards,
