Subject: Request to Work from Home for the Week Due to Child's Health

Dear [Supervisor’s Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to remind you of the email I sent last Friday regarding my unavailability in the second half of the day due to a necessary medical consultation for my child.

Following the consultation, it has become evident that I need to be present for my child's care and recovery this week. Therefore, I am requesting to work from home for the entire week, from [start date] to [end date].

I assure you that I am committed to maintaining my productivity and meeting my responsibilities during this period. I have arranged my workspace at home to ensure minimal disruptions and have planned my schedule to balance my work and caregiving duties effectively. I am confident that I can manage my tasks and be available for any meetings or discussions online.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this time. Please let me know if you need any further information or if there are any forms I should complete as part of this request.

Best regards,
